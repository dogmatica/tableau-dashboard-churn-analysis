# tableau-dashboard-churn-analysis

Churn analysis dashboard representing data that can be used to address customer recruitment by
illustrating which states exhibit the largest percentage of non-customer residents, along with the
total estimated population for those states.

The dashboard also identifies states with the largest degree of churn, cross-referenced with each
state's total estimated population (Churn % With Total Population worksheet). The Churn % By State
worksheet allows the user to view churn percentages for individual states, with the added
functionality to filter the chart by region as well.

Lastly, the Addon Purchases By State worksheet speaks specifically to potential promotions,
delivering a view of the most popular add-on purchases filtered by state.
